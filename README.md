# COVID-19-Cough-Analysis
This project investigated the differences between the coughs of individuals who tested 
positive and negative for COVID-19, and a comparative analysis was employed to determine 
if the features of the signals investigated were successful at indicating the presence 
of the virus within an individual. 

Within this project, the cough audio samples of various patients were displayed in both 
the time and frequency domains to obtain a visual understanding of the differences 
between the coughs and thereafter, six features were selected and extracted from the 
sampled signals. These six features were investigated, and a conclusion was drawn as to
whether there was a correlation between them and the presence of COVID-19.
